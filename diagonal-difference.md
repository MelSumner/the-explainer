## Practical Application

The ability to solve this problem demonstrates the ability to work with multi-dimensional arrays. 

Ways this algorithm could be used: 
- pixel editing- [image kernels](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/) images are often edited based on the pixels that surround them (their "neighborhood")
- computations related to coordinates (tracking objects in space)
- 3-d graphics programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_matrix_(computer_vision))
