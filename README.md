A lot of times I look at interview questions or CS practice problems and think "I never have used this, why are you even asking me this, it has nothing to do with what it is I actually _do_." 

It bothered me enough that I wanted to do something about it. So I'm working through these types of practice problems/interview questions but also spending some time to research and think about practical applications for them. 

This will help me (and maybe some other people too) increase my level of empathy for the existence of these exercises, which are still akin to gatekeeping and seemingly pointless from a practical perspective.
